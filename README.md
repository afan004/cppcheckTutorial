(TL;DR)

Cppcheck is a static code analysis tool for the C and C++ programming 
languages. It is a versatile tool that can check non-standard code. The 
creator and lead developer is Daniel Marjam√§ki. Unlike C/C++ compilers and 
many other analysis tools it does not detect syntax errors in the code. 
Cppcheck primarily detects the types of bugs that the compilers normally do
not detect. 
The goal is to detect only real errors in the code (i.e. have zero false positives).

Cppcheck is free software under the GNU General Public License.
